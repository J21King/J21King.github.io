  <h4>
	As a big tennis fan, I've decided to make a web site on just that: tennis. I used to only play for fun, no lessons or competitions, but eventually I 
	stopped. Years later, a friend of mine who also played convinced me to pick it up again and to try out for the school team. I practice for two weeks, tried 
	out for the team, and it was swiftly decided by the coach that I had no chance. It was then I discovered that I really enjoyed playing tennis, and I made a 
	resolution to take it up seriously. It wasn't cheap, but it paid off. After a year, I improved drastically and tried out for the school team again. 
	I made the cut, and was playing as many matches as I was allowed to shortly after. So in response to my success in tennis, I would like to share the success 
	the best of the best have had and some general tennis info that hopefully other will find helpful.

        <dd>Serbian, ranked world #1 in the WTA, winner of 1 Grand Slam Title (1 French Open).</dt>
        <dt>Achievements:</dt>
		<dd>Ivanovic has no outstanding records, but she has defeated many of the highest ranked tennis players in some of the smaller tournaments. Although 
			she only has 1 Grand Slam Title, her consistently close matches and numerous victories over players like Venus Williams, Maria Sharapova, and 
			Jelena Jankovic has brought her the #1 title.</dd>
        <dt>Playing Style:</dt>
		<dd>Ivanovic is a right-handed player with a two-handed backhand. She is an offensive basliner and relies mainly on her powerful forehand for winning shots.</dd>

        <dd>Spanish, ranked world #2 in the ATP, winner of 5 Grand Slam Titles (4 French Open, 1 Wimbledon).</dt>
        <dt>Achievements:</dt>
		<dd>Winning four consecutive French Open singles titles, defeating Federer to win the 2008 Wimbledon Cup, becoming the second male Spaniard to win
			the Wimbledon title and the first in 42 years.</dt>
        <dt>Playing Style:</dt>
		<dd>Nadal is a left-handed player with a two-handed backhand. Although he is a left-handed player, Nadal is naturally right-handed, which makes his 
			backhand just as powerful as his forehand. His extreme western grip makes his shots have powerful topspin, giving him a larger margin of error 
			and excellent defensive play.</dd>

        <dd>Serbian, ranked world #2 in the WTA, no Grand Slam Titles but has won the ITF Tour and 3 Tier 1 Tournaments.</dd>
        <dt>Achievements:</dt>
		<dd>Like Ana Ivanovic, Jankovic did not rise to the ranks by winning many large tournaments but by defeating higher ranked players. They include 
			Venus Williams, Serena Williams, and Maria Sharapova. In fact, Jankovic doesn't even have one Grand Slam Title; she would have had won the French 
			Open and become ranked #1 had Ivanovic not beat her in the finals.</dd>
        <dt>Playing Style:</dt>
		<dd>Jankovic is a right-handed player with a two-handed backhand. She is classified as a counterpuncher, which means she has great footwork and 
			defensive skills. Her well balanced performance and ability to slide on all surfaces adds to her defensive skills. Jankovic is also known for 
			her signature shot, a two-handed, down the line backhand.</dd>
