<h4>Before I started taking lessons, it never crossed my mind to learn about
	the important details of tennis, like how to hold a racquet properly or even if my technique was correct.
	I just went out and played. Now, I've realized I was wrong, and that what you don't know
	can hurt you. Tennis elbow is defined as "localized pain over the lateral epicondylitis". One cause is
	from improper tennis techniques and it can permanently put your tennis future to rest. That is
	not to say that just by having proper technique, you won't get tennis elbow however. Repetitive stress on the muscles
	around the lateral epicondylitis and aging also cause tennis elbow. These natural causes cannot be helped, but 
	they won't cause tennis elbow as rapidly as poor technique. If you start to feel the symptoms of tennis elbow
	(pain in the outer part of the elbow, pain in wrist extension, pain when lifting with palms face down) you 
	should stop playing tennis and anything else that causes stress to your arm. Rest is the only guaranteed way
	to heal tennis elbow, because tennis elbow is caused by microtearing of the muscles. In more serious cases,
	ice, a massage, and a splint may help, but if it's too serious there's nothing that can remedy it except surgery.
	This page will discuss the minor details in tennis that prevent major injuries.

<h2>1. Grip Types<a name="grip"></a></h2>
	<p class="preview">It cannot be stressed enough how important it is to have the proper grip when holding a racquet. 
		80% of the time, beginning tennis players eventually develop tennis elbow/tendinitis due to improperly holding
		the racquet and failing to correct it. Note that when someone refers to the grip they are using, they
		are referring to the forehand grip. The forehand versions of grips are the commonly known ones, but
		there are backhand versions that are a bit different from their forehand counterparts. For simplicity's
		sake, I will only mention the forehand versions. For one-hand backhands you can use a Continental grip, turning the 
		racquet more counterclockwise to increase topspin. For two-handeD backhands, place your left hand 
		above your right hand; the left are is the dominant arm in a two-handed backhand. Your
		right hand should be using the Eastern or Semi-Western grips for flatter hits, and a Continental grip for
		more topspin.</p>

	<table class="info">
	<tr><th>Continental</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Xn4ZKi8.jpg" title="Continental forehand grip" /></td>
		<td>The Continental grip is best suited for serving, volleying, and slicing. As mentioned before, it 
			is also the choice grip for a one-handed backhanders. It helps lock your wrist and keeps the natural
			flow of your arm, particularly when serving. Knowing the advantages of this grip, you need to know that
			this grip cannot generate any topspin or power in groundstrokes, so don't use it in baseline rallies. 
			To hold this grip, have the plane, or face, of the strings perpindicular to the ground. Then place the 
			palm of your hand 45<sup>o</sup> to the right of the topside of the handle and on the bevel. The top surface 
			should be narrower than the two surfaces to the sides. Being able to use this grip properly will greatly 
			reduce the stress on your wrist. In addition, this grip is a very commonly used by pros, so get familiar 
			with this one.
		</td>
	</tr>

	<tr><th>Eastern</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="http://i.imgur.com/pEMo4Yb.jpg" title="Eastern forehand grip" /></td>
		<td>The Easten grip is the "classic" grip. It is often taught to beginning students, because it flows naturally
			with the movement of the arm and body. The grip is also very versatile, allowing the player to hit flat, 
			topspin, and weak slices with a slight tilt of the racquet face. This grip is more proficient from the 
			forehand side and hitting flat balls than it is on the backhand side and hitting with spin. To use this grip, 
			have the plane of the racquet face parallel to the ground, and place the palm of your hand on the topside of the
			handle. This surface should be the wider side, the exact opposite of the Cintinental grip. On a side note, the 
			decreased amount of spin from using this grip deters pros from using the Eastern grip, and instead they use a 
			more Western grip.
		</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr><th>Semi-Western</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="http://i.imgur.com/hre7vJN.jpg" title="Semi-Western forehand grip" /></td>
		<td>The Semi-Western grip is what many pros like to use now, because it can generate more topspin than the Eastern grip,
			but at the same time, not greatly limit the variety of shots that can be made. This grip does prevent you from slicing,
			or slicing well, but it does great against high balls. High balls are more common now, because of the improving kick
			serves and topspin hits. To hold this grip, follow the instructions for an Eastern grip (plane of strings parallel to
			the ground, palm on wider top surface) then move your hand 45<sup>o</sup> clockwise so the palm of your hand rests on
			the bevel. The face of the racquet would naturally tilt downwards a bit, so you must contact the ball earlier and swing
			upwards more sharply. This is what causes the added topspin.
		</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr><th>Western</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="http://i.imgur.com/bKnjgFF.jpg" title="Western forehand grip" /></td>
		<td>The Western grip isn't as common as the Semi-Western or Eastern grips, but there are great players that use the Western
			grip, a prime example being Rafael Nadal. This grip totally prevents the user from slicing in any way possible, and can
			cause some difficulty when returnting low shots. Like the Semi-Western, high balls are this grip's favourite target. To
			hold this grip, start with the Semi-Western grip and turn your hand another 45<sup>o</sup> to the right. The palm of your
			hand should rest on the narrower, bottom plane of the racquet. It is also a full 90<sup>o</sup> to the right of the Eastern
			grip. This racquet face is severly tilted downwards, so the ball must be met very early and with a fast, upward stroke. This
			causes extreme topspin on the ball.

<h2>2. Types of Shots<a name="shots"></a></h2>
	<p class="preview">Beginners usually don't even care about what kind of shots they make, they just want the ball to stay in so they can get a rally going.
			As beginners get better, they become intermediate players, and like to mix up their shots to keep their opponent from being able to guess
			the shot and responding to it quicker than expected. Then, when you become an advanced player, hitting a variety of shots should be second
			nature, as well as having perfect judgement to when and where you should direct a type of shot. I'm starting to aim my shots, but at the
			same time, I'm still working on getting them over as well. Practice makes perfect =P.</font></p>

	<table class="info">
	<tr><th>Flat/Drive</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Flat hits can be called the plain hits, there's no arm rotation or fancy footwork, it just a swing and a hit. Of course
			you must still follow the basic style for hitting a tennis ball. 70% of the power in a shot comes from the legs, so make 
			sure you bend those legs. Generally, taking your racquet back far and being able to generate pace is good, but if you really
			can't, no worries. That's why they manufacture light racquets with more power; many people have short swings. Beginners usually
			start with short swings and later perfect their technique in order to be able to take larger swings, but if you feel having a 
			short swing is the way to go, no one will argue. Meet the ball in front of your body and not to the side, and accelerate the
			racquet upon impact with the ball. Try to swing parallel to the ground. A drive is basically a flat with more power and more 
			court depth, so that it lands around the baseline.
		</td>
	
	<tr><th>Topspin</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Without topspin, you'll find yourself playing some rather short rallies. Topspin makes the ball drop into the court, so without
			it you'll be unable to hit decent shots and still keep them in. Every grip except the Continental supports topspin, more proof of
			how important topspin is. To add topspin to your ball, you will need to swing your racquet from low to high, not parallel to the
			parallel to the ground. This upward stroke will brush against the back of the ball to create topspin. It's important that you don't
			roll your wrist and try to add too much topspin, because you will then brush the top of the ball and hit it into the net. Just 
			remember to bend your legs, use your other arm for balance, and aim 3-4 inches above the net. You'll use topspin much more often 
			than you will hit flat shots because of the controlled power you can have, but you'll quickly get accustomed to the swing path.
		</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr><th>Slice</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Slices are a bit trickier to hit than, flats or topspin and should therefore not be attempted until you have a decent flat/topspin hit.
			The slice puts backspin on the ball, which makes the ball float in the air and bounce low. It makes for a great approach shot, as well
			as a defensive shot. The slice is like the opposite of the topspin so it is also very different, making it a shot that could throw your
			opponent off if they're not careful. Variety of shots, remember? To perform a backhand slice shot, start with a grip anywhere from an 
			Eastern grip to a Continental grip. Lead with the same foot as your racquet arm, and lean on that leg, bending forwards and approching 
			the ball. Swing the racquet back near your head and keep it upright. Bring the racquet down on the ball and follow through across your 
			body. Make sure that the ball you're trying to hit isn't too low, because unlike a topspin shot, the swing path is from high to low. Make
			sure your wrist is locked the whole way through, and take note that to increase the power of a slice, don't swing faster or try to hit it 
			harder, all you need to do is improve the timing. A forehand slice is similar, with the biggest difference being that you should hit it 
			with an open stance. Keep you feet shoulder width apart, with your left foot farther in front for righties, and vice versa for lefties. 
			Cut down on the ball from above, and finish across your body. Don't open the face too much, otherwise you'll get a floating ball high in
			air that others players just love to kill (a powerful shot usually close to the net, fun to hit).
		</td>
	</tr>

	<tr><th>Drop/Dump</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>The drop shot people should be pretty familiar with, it's a weak ball that just crosses the net and land very close to the net. The shot 
			is much more difficult to hit than it looks, because of the perfect balance of power and control required to just get the ball and no more.
			The drop shot is very commonly combined with a slice to cause the ball to drop bounce even lower. A dump is when you are up at the net and
			just taps the ball so that it falls into the court. The drop shot can be used with any grip, but like volleying, the dump should be hit with
			a continental grip. When used effectively these shots can almost always guarantee a win, and even if they don't they can be used to wear your 
			opponent down since they have to keep running up to return the shot.
		</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr><th>Lob</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>The lob shot is the most underused shot in the game of tennis. Even some pros cannot perform good lobs, because they don't think that a lob shot 
			is worth practicing for. In fact, it is a very deadly shot when it is performed well. Coming to the net and volleying is currently dominating the
			number of points won; part of the reason being that players cannot hit a decent lob shot, and rather risk hitting a much harder to hit passing shot.
			Think about it, a passing shot has quite a small aiming area since the player volleying usually covers 50-80% of the court. If the volleyer is good,
			he/she would have probably hit a good volley so that even if you manage to reach it, you would most likely be off balance. Small aiming area plus
			off balance equals a very hard to hit shot. A lob on the other hand, is a high shot that goes over the volleyers head and lands near the baseline. 
			Indeed, it is tricky to be able to find the right angle and the power needed for the lob, but if you can land it in the baseline it will make it very
			difficult for the volleyer to reach it on time. The type of grip used for this shot doesn't matter, it is a good shot that can be used by all grips, but
			isn't.
		</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr><th>Volley/Half Volley</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Volleying is the main shot for winning points, and quickly too. It is when the player runs up to the net to hit the ball before it land on his side of the
			court. Although it is a relatively easy shot to perform, it is the timing of when to run up to the net that make the shot hard to do. A bad time to run up
			to the net is when you are rallying baseline to baseline. Another bad time is when you are not in control of the ball, meaning that you are on the defensive
			and just returning the ball, rather than on the offensive when you are aiming the ball. When you happen to be on the offensive, that is a good time to run up,
			as well as when your opponent hits a weak ball that lands short. Volleys are usually hit with a Continental grip, but slight variations are also used (a little
			more Eastern or Semi-Western). It is important to know that when you are hitting a volley, don't try too hard and don't bend your wrist. Always keep the racquet 
			pointing up with your wrist locked. To hit lower shots, bend down instead of dropping your arm. The volley is more like blocking the ball, rather than hitting the
			ball, so don't try to muscle it past your opponent, just aim it away from him/her and you'll easily win. The backhand volley is usually a slice, while the forehand 
			volley is often a flat hit. A half volley is usually a defensive shot, hitting the ball right after it bounces. Like a volley, you must stay low, bending your, 
			knees, but it is much harder hit a successful half volley than a volley. Because it is so hard to hit, eye contact and proper technique are essential for a 
			successful return. Aim hit the ball deep and relatively high, don't expect a winner just to return the ball is hard enough. As long as you can keep your opponent 
			from hitting another offensive shot, you have achieved your goal.

<h2>3. Serving<a name="serves"></a></h2>
	<p class="preview">Serving is the hardest aspect in tennis, and so it requires much more practice. Everyone's serve is slightly different, whether it's their toss, swing path, or follow through. 
			Speed of serves also vary, as taller people will have a stronger serve than shorter people. Roddick is the current holder of the fastest serve, which was clocked at 156 miles 
			per hour. The grip that is used for serving should be the Continental grip, but if it leans toward the Eastern grip a little bit, that's fine as well. I will explain how to serve
			in terms for a right-handed player, so for lefties just switch right to left. So you start behind the baseline, with your left foot pointing towards the right net pole and your
			right foot parallel to the baseline. A lot of times, the server bounces the ball a couple of times and leans forward. This is NOT the beginning of the serve, this is just to pump
			the server up. The serve begins when you lean back to toss the ball with the weight on the back foot (right foot). The toss should be practiced a lot, because later on you'll find
			that it is crucial to have your toss in a relative spot in the air. The toss for each serve is slightly different, but more on that later. After the toss, you should be taking your
			racquet back in a semi-circle swing, bending your knees, and preparing to hop into the ball. The more height you can get from a serve, the better, but jumping is not an effective 
			method so stick with a hop. The racquet should be able to tap the back of your head when you bring it back. Don't bring it any lower until you are ready to make contact with the
			ball. When you are, drop the racquet head down, tuck your elbow in, shoot the racquet upwards and twist your wrist. Make contact with the ball at the highest point, and finish off 
			with the racquet ending at the left side of your hip.</p>

	<table class="info">
	<tr><th>Flat</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="http://i.imgur.com/gHvf9Fl.jpg" /></td>
		<td>This most likely the first kind of serve you'll learn. It has no spin and cuts through the air very fast. It is this that gave it the nickname, "cannonball" serve. It
			makes for a great first serve because of the power, but not a good second serve due to its low accuracy. It needs to be aimed low, just over the net, in order for it 
			to be in. A good time to use it is if you're trying to hit down the line, since the center of the net is lower. In terms of where the toss is for serves, imagine a clock
			in front of you, where 12 o'clock is directly up and 3 o'clock is to your right. A flat serve should have a toss at 12 o'clock, throwing more outwards when you are able
			to jump higher.
		</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr><th>Slice</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="http://i.imgur.com/xCp2HNC.jpg" /></td>
		<td>A slice serve is hit with sidespin, which requires the server to brush the back of the ball toward their dominant side with the racket. 
			It is commonly hit with the Continental grip or the Eastern backhand grip. The ball is thrown slightly to the dominant side of the server 
			then is struck laterally on the server's dominant side. For a right-handed player, a sliced serve's sidespin causes the ball to curve 
			leftward. When the ball bounces, it skids and curves farther leftward. Since a slice serve has little or no topspin on it, it cannot be 
			aimed high over the net and has little margin for error. Therefore, it is generally used as a first serve.
		</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr><th>Kick</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="http://i.imgur.com/7OHproH.jpg" /></td>
		<td>The kick (or topsin) serve is generated by tossing the ball over the head, then hitting it laterally on the server's non-dominant side 
			brushing upward toward the dominant side. When hit correctly, the ball clears the net in a high arc with heavy topspin, causing the ball to 
			dive into the service box. Upon hitting the surface of the court, the ball may bounce high directly toward the receiver for a kick serve. 
			The physics of the spinning ball in flight involves the Magnus effect because the spinning ball creates a whirlpool of air around itself.

<h2>4. Types of Courts<a name="courts"></a></h2>
	<p class="preview"></p>

	<table class="info">
	<tr><th>Clay</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>A clay court is one of many different types of tennis court. Clay courts are made of crushed shale, stone or brick. The French Open 
			uses clay courts, making it unique among the Grand Slam tournaments. Clay courts are more common in Continental Europe and Latin America 
			than in the United States, Canada or Britain. Two types exist: red clay, the more common variety, and green clay, also known as "rubico", 
			which is a harder surface. Although less expensive to construct than other types of tennis courts, the maintenance costs of clay are high 
			as the surface must be rolled to preserve flatness. The water content must also be balanced; green courts are often sloped in order to 
			allow water run-off.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><th>Grass</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>A grass court is one of the four different types of court on which the sport of tennis, originally known as "lawn tennis", is played. 
			Grass courts are made of grasses in different compositions depending on the tournament. Although grass courts are more traditional than 
			other types of tennis courts, maintenance costs of grass courts are higher than those of hard courts and clay courts. Grass courts (in the 
			absence of suitable covers) must be left for the day if rain appears, as the grass becomes very slippery when wet. Grass courts are most 
			common in Britain, although the Northeastern United States also has some private grass courts.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><th>Hard</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Tennis hard courts are made of synthetic/acrylic layers on top of a concrete or asphalt foundation and can vary in color. These courts 
			tend to play medium-fast to fast because there is little energy absorption by the court, like in grass courts. The ball tends to bounce high 
			and players are able to apply many types of spin during play. Flat balls are favored on hard courts because of the extremely quick play style. 
			Speed of rebound after tennis balls bounce on hard courts is determined by how much sand is in the synthetic/acrylic layer placed on top of the 
			asphalt foundation. More sand will result in a slower bounce due to more friction. Of the Grand Slam tournaments, the US Open and Australian 
			Open currently use hard courts and it is the predominant surface type used on the professional tour.
