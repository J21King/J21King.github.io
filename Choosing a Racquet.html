<h4>I've been told that it's not the clothes that make the man, or in this case, the racquet that
	makes the player. I, however, must disagree with this saying. When I first start playing I used a
	beginner Wilson racquet: a titanium graphite racquet, mid-plus, medium string tension, with
	a moderately stiff frame. Now I use a Prince Shark: a titanium tungsten carbon racquet, oversize, 
	medium-low string tension, with a medium stiff frame. At this moment, it may be difficult to see
	how all of this could affect ones gameplay. With this page I hope to convey how crucial racquet choice is. 
	The specifications I listed in the two racquets above are key numbers that should be observed when choosing 
	a racquet. There are many sites that cover different aspects of choosing a racquet, but I will condense 
	the main points onto this page. Lastly, it is very important to ask to demo racquets that you may be 
	considering before purchasing it; a racquet before it is strung and used is vastly different from one in 
	the hand. As a bonus he rental fee is usually subtracted from the final cost of a racquet if you purchase it in the end.

<h2>1. Frames<a name="frames"></a></h2>
	<p class="preview">To begin, here are the main statistics of frames and their effects on you gameplay (take note 
		that the frame consists of a head, shoulder, throat, shaft, and handle):</p>
	<table class="info">
	<tr><th>Size<th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<ul>
			<li>midsize: 85-95in<sup>2</sup></li>
			<li>mid-plus: 95-105in<sup>2</sup></li>
			<li>oversize: 105in<sup>2</sup>+</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The larger the head size, the more power you will generate, but you will also have less control
			and comfort. It is a fact that if you want more power, control will have to be sacrificed. A
			larger head size also means that there is more string surface area, resulting in more spin on
			a ball, which is a different kind of control (always in, rather than where you want it to be).
			Also, comfort refers to how much vibration your arm will feel. The more comfortable a racquet
			is said to be, the less vibration your arm will feel. In turn, it will also be less damaging
			to your arm, and will reduce the chance of tennis elbow. A larger head size is also more
			forgiving, since there is a larger sweet spot on the racquet face.</p>
		</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr><th>Length</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<ul>
			<li>average length: 27in</li>
			<li>extra long: 27in+</li>
		</ul>
			<p>The longer the racquet, the more power that can be generated since a small pivot from the wrist
				translates to a sharp pivot at the end of the racquet. Longer racquets are also useful for
				shorter players, as the extra reach provided in serving and vollying can make a big difference.
				Like a larger head size, the increase in string surface area will add more spin to the ball.
				Of course, the added length means that there is a decrease in manoeuvrability, which limits its
				usefulness.</p>
		</td>
	</tr>

	<tr><th>Weight</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<ul>
			<li>light frames: 225-280g</li>
			<li>medium frames: 280-300g</li>
			<li>heavy frames: 300g+</li>
		</ul>
			<p>The heavier the racquet, the more power that will be generated. A heavier frame also has a larger
				sweet spot, so it is more forgiving. It is also more comfortable, since the weight of the racquet
				can help take the impact of the ball. So what exactly is the downside of a heavy racquet? Other than
				a minor loss of control, there is none! It is recommended that you get the heaviest possible racquet
				that you can wield. Of course, if it's so heavy you can't swing it, the loss of speed in your swing 
				would decrease the power of your shots more than the extra weight would increase it...</p>
		</td>
	</tr>

	<tr><th>Balance</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<ul>
			<li>head heavy</li>
			<li>even</li>
			<li>head light</li>
		</ul>
			<p>Balance is a tricky stat. The three types of racquets are self explanatory, but to say which one is better
				largely depends on you. Head heavy would give you more power, in exchange for less comfort, while a head 
				light racquet would be vice versa. Even is even, need I say more? Pros tend the use head light racquets,
				since they are able to generate pace on their own. Beginners would use head heavy since little effort is
				required to hit a powerful shot. I would recommend a lighter head, since it is not worth injuring you arm
				permanently for a little bit of extra power. A quick test for checking the balance, balance (no pun intended)
				the racquet by one of the two top corners of the throat with one finger. That is usually the very middle of
				a racquet, so if tilts head down, then the racquet is heavy. If it tilts handle down, then it's head light.</p>
		</td>
	</tr>

	<tr><th>Flex</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<ul>
			<li>flexible</li>
			<li>stiff</li>
		</ul>
			<p>A stiff frame can generate more power, because it won't bend under the force of the ball. Flexible frames would
				deform upon the impact of the ball, and absorb some of the balls energy. A stiff frame also provides a large sweet 
				spot, since there is uniform ball response across the plane of the strings.The shock load to the arm is much greater 
				on the other hand, and control is decreased.</p>
		</td>
	</tr>

	<tr><th>Material</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<ul>
			<li>graphite: stiff and light, mid-high cost racquets</li>
			<li>titanium: stiff and light, mid cost racquets</li>
			<li>aluminum: flexible and light, low cost racquets</li>
			<li>ceramic: very stiff and heavy, mid cost racquets</li>
			<li>fiberglass: very flexible and light, low-mid cost racquets</li>
		</ul>
			<p>The material is what the weight and flex of a racquet is largely based on. However, with material there is the
				extra aspect of cost. Graphite is what the best racquets are made of. There are some racquets that say they are 
				made of 100% graphite, but 40% of it is actually resin. Plus, the graphite in racquets is actually carbon fibers,
				not that brittle graphite used in pencil lead. If the racquet is not "100% graphite", it is called a composite 
				racquet (composite means combined). Composite graphite racquets are often combined with titanium, which is like
				cheaper, not as good version of graphite. Aluminum is something cheap that is alright for beginners, but pros
				wouldn't dream of using it. Flexible and light take away power, remember? Ceramic and fiberglass, now those are
				two interesting materials. Fiberglass is way too flexible to be used on its own, so it's only found in composite
				racquets. Ceramic's incredible stiffness makes it brittle as well. This limits its usage, so it's rare to see 
				racquets that have ceramic in them.</p>

<h2>2. Strings<a name="strings"></a></h2>
	<p class="preview">Many players spend huge amounts of time picking out a racquet, but only 5 minutes on picking string. Since the strings are the only
		part of a racquet that should make contact with the ball, I would guess the type of string is rather important! You know what, they
		are, and here's why:</p>
	<table class="info">
	<tr><th>Tension</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<ul>
			<li>higher tension</li>
			<li>lower tension</li>
		</ul>
			<p>Higher tension will result in less power, more control, and less comfort. A lower tension will give you more power
				less control, and more comfort. Why? There is a very simple explanation from that. Imagine punching something that 
				is soft and rubbery. It would bounce your punch back with minimal effort. Likewise, strings that have low tension 
				will easily bounce balls back (more comfort), and with some extra pace (more power). This is called the trampoline
				effect, since the face of the racquet is similar to that of a trampoline. Tight strings are stiffer, which makes it 
				harder on your arm, and harder to hit with more power. The trampoline effect, however, drops control quite a bit, due
				to the fact that if the ball hits your racquet from an angle or with some spin, it would bounce off your racquet in
				a more random direction than if the strings were taut. What tension to use is based on two things: 1. Whatevery tension
				you feel you like, and 2. The recommended tension of your racquet. Each racquet has specified tensions for maximum
				effectiveness, but if still ranges quite a bit, so you still have some freedom with whether you want high or low tension.</p>
		</td>
	</tr>

	<tr><th>Distance Apart</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<ul>
			<li>closer</li>
			<li>farther</li>
		</ul>
			<p>The distance I'm referring to is the difference between the strings. This doesn't affect comfort, but it does affect power,
				control, and spin. Powerwise, the farther the strings are, the more power that can be generated. This is because
				the farther the strings are, the less criss-crossing there is. With less criss-crossing, the strings will be more flexible
				and be able to bend more as well. In terms of control: where you want the ball to be, closer string will give you more. For
				spin control: always in, farther strings will help you out. It seems strange that the less number of strings that brush against
				the ball, the more power you will have. If you think about it, however, close strings don't really allow the strings to get a good
				on the ball. Farther strings really "bite" into the ball, since each string would brush against the ball more.</p>
		</td>
	</tr>

	<tr><th>Material</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<ul>
			<li>natural gut</li>
			<li>nylon</li>
			<li>polyester</li>
			<li>kevlar</li>
		</ul>
			<p>Natural gut is the oldest type of string around. It was the best string back then, and it still is. If you can afford it, natural
				gut is a nice option because it is the most resilient. By the way, natural gut is really made from beef intestines. Nylon is what
				almost everyone uses today, excluding pros. Nylon is almost exactly the same as synthetic gut, except synthetic gut may be a grade
				higher. It's a good all-around string that fits well with any playing style, you can't go wrong. Polyester string is very durable,
				but not very playable. That's because polyester strings are usually thicker than nylon, and this makes it have low flex. Kevlar is 
				the most durable string around, is also very stiff. Players using kevlar for the first time should lower the tension down by 10%, 
				to account for the stiffness.</p>

<h2>3. Others<a name="others"></a></h2>
	<p class="preview">This section doesn't really help you to pick a racquet; it's just where all the leftover information goes. It mainly talks about 
						the names of accesories and what they do. Think of it as an "extras" section.</p>
	<table class="info">
	<tr><th>Grip</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<ul>
			<li>replacement grip</li>
			<li>overgrip</li>
		</ul>
			<p>The first and most important thing I need to mention is that the overgrip is NOT the same as the replacement grip. A replacement grip
				has adhesive, padding, and other features. It goes directly on the handle, and is cost a bit more than an overgrip. An overgrip is a
				thin strip of material that covers the replacement grip. It has no adhesive, and can only be use for short periods of time. It helps
				absorb sweat and provides addtional grip and comfort. Overgrips are usually cheap, which is good since they often need to be replaced.
				Some replacement grips look and feel very much the same as an overgrip, but don't be fooled.</p>

			<li>dampener

			<li>grommet strip <img src="http://i.imgur.com/ExUEoI7.jpg" title="Grommet Strip" /></li>
			
		</ul>
			<p>We'll start with dampeners, most people know what they already are, but do they know what they do? For those of you who are new to the game,
				dampeners are usually rubber pieces that clip on to the string to reduce the vibration. They come in single, long, worm, and rubberband, in
				increasing effectiveness. Pros like to use the classic rubberband, but it's still up to you to how much you want your string to be dampened. 
				I would stay away from the worms though, because they take too much touch and feel from the racquet. Keep in mind that the more effective the
				dampener, the more it will increase the string tension. Also, there is also a myth going around that dampeners do little good, and that the
				vibrations aren't all that harmful. I still use one anyway, at least it gets rid of that annoying "ding" sound. Moving on, a bumper guard is 
				the plastic strip at the top of the racquet head. It protects the outside frame from bangs and scrapes. The bumper guard is attached to the
				grommet strip, which is a plastic strip with small tubes that runs through the frame's string holes. The grommet strip protects the strings
				from rubbing against the abrasive frame material. It's not really an accessory, but it's a neat term to know. The last accessory is the butt
				cap. It's the cap at the bottom of your handle, and it usually has a nice image on it for spinning and deciding who serves first in a match.</p>

<h2>4. Brand Names<a name="brand names"></a></h2>
	<p class="preview">Alright, here's what everybody wants to know: of all the biggest brand names in tennis which one is the best? Of course by now, you should 
						understand that there is no such thing as the best, it's all a matter of preference. See which brand fits you, but remember that I've only listed

			<dd>The Pure Team range has medium power, but a lot of control and comfort. They usually come in standard length to extra long and have oversize heads. These
                racquets also incorporates a new cortex system that filters out undesirable vibrations, but doesn't affect feel. This makes it so players won't have to lose that
                feel if they want to reduce damaging vibrations to the arm.</dd>
		<dt>Aeropro</dt>
			<dd>The Aeropro range has medium-high power and are generally head light. They have a faster swing speed and acceleration, which generates a lot more topspin. The cortex
                system is also added to these racquets. Rafael Nadal uses the Aeropro Drive Cortex racquet.</dd> 
		<dt>Drive Z Cortex</dt>
			<dd>The Drive Z Cortex range has high power and is known for its light frame. The frame is also stiff and has added stability to even out the lightness of the racquet. The
                lightness is due to the new zylon matrix technology added to these racquets, along with the new cortex system.</dd>
		<dt>NS</dt>
			<dd>The NS (Nano Strength) range has very high power and uses nanotechnology for high stability. These racquets are very stiff, have a large heads, and are light. There
                are nanotubes at the three and nine o'clock positions in the head for added stability. NS range is designed for intermediate players, not pros.</dd>

			<dd>The M-Fil (Multi-Filament) range offer a good balance in power, control, and feel. They multi-filament construction gives additional stiffness to the racquets,
                    while keeping them relatively light at the same time. The have a medium-large head, making it more forgiving. These racquets are very well rounded, and are
                    good racquets to try out, but I don't suggest get one if you were considering playing seriously. Both Tommy Haas and James Blake have used these racquets before.</dd>
		<dt>Aerogel</dt>
			<dd>The Aerogel range has low-medium power, but it has exceptional spin control and very good feel. It uses aerogel technology combined with the multi-filament technology
                    to make the racquet very light but stable as well. These racquets have been nicknamed "Frozen Smoke" because of their lightness and the transparency of their frames.</dd>

		</dt>
		<dt>Metallix</dt>
			<dd>The Metallix range has high power, but medium control and feel. They have large heads, and are somewhat light. Incorporated into these racquets is a metal alloy called
                metallix, which is a very fine grain alloy, resulting in a much more solid metal. Combined with a special design for the carbon fibres, more power is added to every shot.</dd>
		<dt>Flexpoint</dt>
			<dd>The Flexpoint range has special design that allows for more power AND control. Powered by liquidmetal, flexpoint technology has two control holes in the three and nine o'clock
                positions of the racquet head. This causes the racquet the bend in a controlled way upon impact of the ball. These racquets are good for aggressive players who are looking for
                extra power with having to lose too much control.</dd>
		<dt>Women's Airflow</dt>
			<dd>The Women's Airflow range is obviously for women only, and the difference is that it is lightweight and very powerful, has perfect balance, and an ergonomic grip. These added
                elements were based on interviews from women around the world. The main effect is that it reduces twist and stress on the arm.</dd>
		<dt>Microgel</dt>
			<dd>The Microgel range has medium power and has incredible feel and touch. Microgel is a silicone based material that has very low density, and combined with stiff and strong carbon 
                fibres, these racquets have great responsive qualities. The trick is that the shock is evenly distributed around the frame, providing a solid feel.</dd>

                have incredible control and comfort, even on mis-hits. These racquets are light as well, helping you increase your swing speed further. I love Prince racquets because of the control
                they have, without the huge loss of power. Despite the fact that there is only one sub-category, there is still a huge variety of racquets to choose from.</dd>

		<dt>Women's W Line</dt>
			<dd>The Women's W Line is designed for female players, which is done by making the racquets very light yet powerful. In many ways, this would be similar to the Head Women's Airflow range,
                since they are both made lightweight and powerful. In my experience, Wilson tends to have more control than comfort, while head would be vice versa.</dd>
		<dt>nCode</dt>
			<dd>The nCode range has low-medium power and is very solid and stable. They are somewhat heavy, but are usually head light, which balances out very evenly. Silicone oxide crystals close
                any air spaces between the carbon fibres, increasing strength and stability.</dd>
		<dt>[K] Factor</dt>
			<dd>The K-Factor range has low power and is quite heavy. It is balanced out with extreme control and spin control, which is great for serving and volleying. It is very aerodynamic though,
                so if you have an extremely hard hit or are an advanced player, these racquets are a good choice. The K-Factor racquets have four new technologies to enhance [K]ontrol. These four are
                [K]arophite Black, [K]onnector, [K]ontour Yoke, and [K]ompact Center. Together, these four components add a lot of stability and strength to the frame. Roger Federer helped design these
                components, and is currently using the K-Factor K One Six Tour racquet. Novak Djokovic is using another K-Factor racquet, the K-Factor K-Blade Tour.</dd>

                are great for slicing.</dd>
		<dt>RQiS & RQS</dt>
			<dd>The RQiS and RQS range is slightly more improved that the RDS series, in that, it has more power and stability due to lighter weight and a faster swing speed. They also have a larger sweet 
                spot, making them accurate even for off center shots. Yonex hasn't released too many new models lately, and in my opinion, there are better racquets out there. </dd>
